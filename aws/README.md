# DataOps Lab - AWS

This directory contains a collection of hands-on projects and components focused on DataOps using key AWS services.

The goal is to build a solid and applied foundation in **data engineering, data architecture, data quality, observability, performance, and FinOps**, using best practices in automation, version control, and infrastructure as code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Build data pipelines in controllable (non-managed) environments  
- Monitor and control quality, performance, observability, and cost  
- Apply DevOps/DataOps concepts across all layers of the stack  
- Showcase practical and multiplatform knowledge (GCP, AWS, Databricks)  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

Each module has its own `README.md` with:
- Context and project explanation  
- Usage instructions (infrastructure, code, dependencies)  
- Provisioning scripts (Terraform, bash)  
- Examples for running locally or in the cloud  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Minimum Requirements

- AWS account with permissions to create resources (IAM, EC2, S3, Glue, Athena, etc.)  
- Docker and Docker Compose  
- Python 3.10+ with virtualenv  
- Terraform (optional but recommended)

## ðŸ“¬ Contribution and Evolution

This repository will be expanded with new examples, tests, best practices, and real-world cases.

Feel free to suggest improvements, open issues, or contribute with ideas and automations.
